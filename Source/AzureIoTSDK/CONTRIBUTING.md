# Ask a question
Our team monitors Stack Overflow, especially the [azure-iot-hub](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-iot-hub) tag. It really is the best place to ask.

We monitor the Github issues section specifically for bugs found with our SDK, however we will reply to questions asked using Github issues too.

# File a bug (code or documentation)
That is definitely something we want to hear about. Please open an issue on github, we'll address it as fast as possible. Typically here's the information we're going to ask for to get started:
- What SDK are you using (Node, C, C#, Python, Java?)
- What version of the SDK?
- Do you have a snippet of code that would help us reproduce the bug?
- Do you have logs showing what's happening?

Our SDK is entirely open-source and we do accept pull-requests if you feel like taking a stab at fixing the bug and maybe adding your name to our commit history :) Please mention
any relevant issue number in the pull request description.

# Contribute documentation
For simple markdown files, we accept documentation pull requests submitted against the `master` branch, if it's about existing SDK features.
If your PR is about future changes or has changes to the comments in the code itself, we'll treat is as a code change (see the next section).

# Contribute code
Unlike documentation, we require pull-requests for code to be submitted against the `develop` branch in order to review and run it in our gated build system. We try to maintain a high bar
for code quality and maintainability, we insist on having tests associated with the code, and if necessary, additions/modifications to the requirement documents.

Also, have you signed the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/))? A friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit your pull-request.

If you feel like your contribution is going to be a major effort, you should probably give us a heads-up. We have a lot of items captured in our backlog and we release every two weeks, so before you spend the time, just check with us to make
sure your plans and ours are in sync :) Just open an issue on github and tag it "enhancement" or "feature request"
